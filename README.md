# 🧠 Understanding the Need of Ordinal Encoding

## 📦 Libraries Used
- numpy  
- pandas  
- sklearn (OrdinalEncoder, LabelEncoder)

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset is available in the repo.  
- Contains columns: **Age**, **Gender**, **Review**, and **Education**.  
- For this task, we focus on **Review** and **Education** only.

---

## 🧩 Why Ordinal Encoding?
- **Ordinal Encoding** is used when categorical variables have a **meaningful order or ranking**.  
- Example:  
  - *Poor < Average < Good*  
  - *School < UG < PG*  
- Encoding them numerically helps ML models understand these ordered relationships.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation
- Selected relevant features: `Review` and `Education`.  
- Performed **train-test split** for model readiness.

---

### 2️⃣ Applying Ordinal Encoding
- Imported `OrdinalEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.  
- Created the encoder object:
  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder
  oe = OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['Poor', 'Average', 'Good'], ['School', 'UG', 'PG']])
Applied encoding on the dataset.

Converted the transformed output back into a DataFrame for clarity.

The encoded values were as follows:

Review: Poor → 0, Average → 1, Good → 2

Education: School → 0, UG → 1, PG → 2

### 3️⃣ Applying Label Encoding

Label Encoding is used for encoding the target/output variable only.

Encoded the output column using:

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
y_encoded = le.fit_transform(y)


Received the output as a numeric array.

## 📈 Key Takeaways

Ordinal Encoding maintains the order among categorical features.

Label Encoding is meant for the target variable.

These encodings make data machine-readable and improve model performance when order or category distinction matters.
